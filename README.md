# DataWave

###What is it?
DataWave is an Android application that allows a user to browse the internet through the use of FM radio. 

The Android app is a client. The server is located [here](https://github.com/datawaveteam/DataWaveDesktop).

###Documentation
Current documentation is very slim just because we haven't really had the time to work on it. Will come soon.

###Contact
